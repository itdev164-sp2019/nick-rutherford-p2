Just wanted to announce today I faced my fear of public speaking head on, and couldn’t be anymore happier with the results. I never thought I could get in front of a room with one hundred people, and deliver a pitch. But I did.. In Fact I did it in a way that was different from everyone else by invoking one thing..passion. Passion is truly what makes people invested, and even changes people’s  ideas or ways of thinking. Here let me explain…

 

You see this all started with me being selected as a startup founder, under a company called The Commons. Which means that my idea had to be pitched in front of over one hundred other people, and my goal was to capture aspiration from people. You have so many people day by day, that dont invoke on the true cause of what makes them different; or even what makes them engaging, Which leads to people not following you because they cant see passion, direction, or even enlightenment. People need to see things in you in order to buy into truly who you are as a person, which is something I felt like I truly did today.

 

The goal is to connect with everyone in the room on a personal, and even professional basis. But how do you do that? Before I went into that room I saw everyone, and noticed a trend with the audience; we were all college students. College students from the moment they start their path to even after they end, they are always trying to find their footing in there life. They have to go from interview to interview, potentially hearing there not good enough; and the only time they may hear differently is with their friends and family. But what if I can make them feel like this is different, that everyone is accepted and no one is decline. Everyone becomes valuable, and everyone will invest in you as a genuine person. I can’t believe I accomplished my goal, and will continue to looking forward changing the world one step at a time.
