In life,  I feel you must have people that are there for you through thick and thin. Friends come and go but I feel people are kinda like a dartboard. You have to keep throwing your darts until that dartboard(that one person), sticks and is capable of dealing with the cons that you deliver to a relation.  Okay maybe that wasn’t the best example, but the point is clear that good people are very hard to come by. This blog I am going to be talking a lot about computing programming but sometimes its good to take a step back,  and talk about a new topic. I am happy to announce that a perfect timing with starting this degree I have met that one person,  that one dartboard.

She is a magnificent person, one that has helped me with my problems. I met her earlier this year, and In a little amount of time she has given me a new direction on ambitions and goals. Now I was once a person, who wanted to throw in the towel when something became to challenging for me. I did it throughout my whole life, and because of that I wasn’t able to exemplify qualities I knew I can assure. She saw that, and at times where I can say I didn’t believe in myself she told me that she “believed in me”. She saw what I could do and what I was capable of, and because of that she made me stronger by pushing me to limits.

 

Now helping me is something that she has done, but its not just about helping I think its about investing. We have spent countless nights, getting to know each others strengths and weaknesses. You cannot add a key component to your life, if that component is someone who is a stranger to you. This is why we spend countless days and nights with each other, to extract our strengths and weaknesses. While extracting we talk about our dreams, our goals, and  where we want to be in the next ten plus years.

 

She is currently in college and working, so she is someone who is doing something with there life. Many people talk about how they want to do something, but never want to actually put in the time and work to achieve that. She is aware that she has to push the envelope in order to guarantee her success. Knowing this I can look at her and smile, and say that this is someone who I want to surround myself with.

 

Now I know, I could go on and on with talking how she has helped me become the person I am today. But while this blog is to show how special she to my life and success, it has another message. The message is that, to find people who will help you achieve everything you want to achieve. For example I want to land a job in developing and from than create something that has never been created before. Revolutionize the way we see something in the normal eye, and make it diff rent. Now I know with going to college and learning independently,  I know I will have the tools to make that dream become a reality. However, I need her in order to push me and make sure that I do not lose sight of that important goal. Generating happiness from people is the best happiness in the world.

 

My advice, is find yourself a dartboard. One that no matter how many darts you throw, that person will be there with support and compassion. I can say that she Is my family which is the biggest endorsement, as I love my family more than I love myself. Just remember that if you throw those darts at the dartboard and it doesn’t stick, that another dartboard will appear in your life. Do not settle it could be the worst mistake that you ever make. Find happiness, and live life on the edge,  you never know when that one person can become the difference maker.
