Throughout my life I can think of many times where I have stayed quite. Society wants to keep us in a bubble, but what happens when we burst that bubble? There have been countless times where I have wanted to speak up however I did not, because lack of courage. In a recent TED talk called “Get Comfortable With  Being Uncomfortable”, it talked about the difficulties of stepping up to the plate and recognizing who you are.

Luvvie Ajayi, a successful author and speaker talked about her position that I can relate to. In the presentation she talked about how she was going to college,  to become a doctor. She received her first ever “D” in college, and from there was the moment that she decided to speak out about it. One of the most hardest things is recognizing your career, is not your actual career.Elevating and changing as a person, is something that was done to get her to that decision. For the first time in her life, she made a choice that  many of her friends and family would find displeasing.

Relating this to me, I  to had to speak up when the time presented itself. Going to college for Culinary Arts, I was very fixated on not only finishing but aspiring to become a chef. No one in my family has never really graduated from college, because of that there was extra pressure added on  to finish. So when the day came when I had to look myself in the mirror, and state this wasn’t for me became the hardest decision of my life. When you put so much time and or effort into something and it doesn’t pan out, at the time you could feel as if you are a disappointment.

Overtime adjustment became easier, as I were able to go to college for what I wanted to be. This was just an example of how I spoke up, in a time where I really needed to. This idea works as if its a domino effect, people lack courage in order to test the credentials on what’s right or wrong. But as soon as you have at least one person, many others will follow which is what Luvvie stated in her speech. When Luvvie choose not to become a doctor, not only did that portion of her life changed everything else did. Her lifestyle became a whole new one, and she was able to live life in the most unpredictable, uncomfortable position ever. When you really look at her way of living, there isn’t any other way of living that could become more happier than her’s. Not only is she able to live her life how she wants to, she is also able to never be someone she isn’t.

Thinking deeper it’s  all about control of who you are as a person. It all depends on who you are to dictate the decisions you make, but you should never be a false copy of yourself. Your niche goes beyond what you wanna be in your life, it sticks with who you truly are. Understanding this so many people have came into my life that wanted me to adjust, and become a person that I had no knowledge of being. As I was very displeased to see them leave in my life, over time I was thrilled and excited for the next set of people to come into my life. If you are in this circumstance that someone wants you to change, that is a position that you should leave immediately.   Take a ride on this route call life, and make sure to enjoy the ride you never know when a new route will approach you.
